    <h2>Biography</h2> 	

    	<p>Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is an American singer-songwriter and record producer.</p>

		<p>After an unsuccessful stint with Motown Records, Mars signed with Atlantic Records in 2009. He became recognized as a solo artist after lending his vocals and co-writing the hooks for the songs "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B, and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy. He also helped write the hits "Right Round" by Flo Rida featuring Kesha, "Wavin' Flag" by K'naan, and "Forget You!" by Cee Lo Green. In October 2010, he released his album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. The album reached number three on the Billboard 2003. He was nominated for seven Grammys at the 53rd Grammy Awards, winning Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Just the Way You Are". His singles "Just the Way You Are", "Nothin' on You", "Grenade", "Locked Out of Heaven", "When I Was Your Man", "Uptown Funk", "Billionaire", "The Lazy Song", "It Will Rain", and "24K Magic" have all reached the top five of the US Billboard Hot 100, with the first six reaching number one.</p>

		<p>Mars has sold 10 million albums around the world.</p>

		<p>In 2013, his song "Locked Out of Heaven" was nominated for a Grammy Award.
